**Technologies notes:**
One Xbox 360 controller is required for the game to be played. The two players will have only one controller: • The one with the keyboard have the ability of moving using "A" and "D" keys. These keys represent the doll's feets, so you need to press one and another each time you want to walk. If you put your mouse over the doll's hands and click it, you'll notice that it toogles an attack animation. Maybe you should try it on the ennemies ? • The one with the xbox controller can use the left stick to change Arthur's direction. He may also jump using the "A" key , and interact with the environement when pressing "X"
